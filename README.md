# FoodiesBudgetTool
CSCI 380 Group Project Spring 2021

This is a Budgeting Tool for Foodies. We are students who love to explore new flavors and cultures. We enjoy both eating out and creating delicious meals in our homes. Great meals can get expensive and we are creating this tool to maximize our resources and enjoyment. We hope you find it useful too!
